## TreeviewFrom/ToFile


</div>

### Description

This example builds on Srinis example found on www.vb-helper.com.

Srinis example loaded data to a treeview from a text file with tabs

denoting indentation.

My contribution is the save treeview to file function.

It only saves one level of childs, it was all I needed for my other project.

Srinis example loads more than one level of childs. I am shure some small

modifications to my example will enable it to save multiple levels of childs,

but thats your jobb ;)
 
### More Info
 
Nothing. This is a example application demonstrating the use of the functions LoadTreeviewFromFile and SaveTreeviewToFile.

Both functions is in the basefile modTreeView.bas, wich can easly bee included in your own projects.
